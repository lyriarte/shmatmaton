Shmatmaton
==========

Shmatmaton - stack, heap, matrix, automaton - is a programming language.

This is an attempt at doing "breedable code", as in genetic algorithms.
Intermingling the lines of code of a pair of shmatmaton programs should 
produce another syntactically correct shmatmaton program - the behaviour
of the latter being anyone's guess.
